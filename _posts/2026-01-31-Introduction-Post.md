## New Experiences

I have used markdown with [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) before, so I am fairly experienced with the type setting functionality of `.md` files. With that being said, I am still new to `HTML`, so the combination of `.md` files and `.html` files are definitely new to me. 

## Struggles

So far, I have not had many struggles. I think the hardest part is just going to be learning a new type-setting language, but since I have a strong background, I think I should be able to get caught up quickly (*fingers crossed*).

## Confusing Aspects

These are some of the confusing aspects:
- Including in-file `HTML` content. 
- Styling webpages with `CSS`. 

## Exciting Features

In general, I am really excited about this new blog. I saw that, unlike obsidian, it seems like Jekyll doesn't natively come with [KaTeX](https://katex.org/), but I also saw that it's possible to add through the `_config.yml` file. That aspect of being able to modify the `_config.yml` file adds more functionality that I wouldn't have access to with obsidian, so that's cool. 

I **really** like the linting that is native with VSCode. It makes it so that I can see a preview of what the text is going to look like before I render it, even if that only takes a refresh of the page.
