Upon completing Lab 3, I had some struggles trying to get the `.cscc` file to work properly. That is definitely going to be something that I have to play around with a bit more before it feels natural. With that being said, everything else was pretty straightforward! It's nice working with `.md` files, as they are much more streamlined than `.html` files. The [catan](../../../../catan.html) file took a long while to put everything together, but I think it was worth it because I had fun with the table and hyperlinks (even if the rules are not all the way complete). I am looking forward to doing more with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) and making more posts. It's pretty neat that you can just load a template, and then immediately jump into a new project or blog post in a matter of seconds. Definitely beats setting up a new `head` and `body` everytime I need to make a `.html` file.

I couldn't really think of any pictures that are closely related to the content of this file, but I found these that I think go nicely:
