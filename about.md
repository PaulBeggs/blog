Hi there! My name is Paul Beggs. I go to Hendrix College in Conway, Arkansas, and this is my final semester. I 
am currently enrolled in [CSC 340: *Database and Web Systems*](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci340/index.html), 
where I am learning about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and plenty of other web organization tools. 
Soon, we will be learning about databases, and how to manipulate them.
