## Game Initialization

Catan is a board game that 2-4 people can play at a time. 
There are plenty of expansion packs and DLCs that you can combine to the board so more people can play, but this page is not intended for that. 
Instead, the goal is to provide a condensed version of the game rules, provided [here](https://www.catan.com/sites/default/files/2021-06/catan_base_rules_2020_200707.pdf).

Pictured below is what an average game of Catan would look like.

Each player is designated with a color, and where they sit at the table determines the order in which they play. There are 5 resources in the game: Grain, Lumber, Wool, Brick, and Ore (each resource has an associated tile; go to [Board Layout](#board-layout) for more). These resources are used to make items in the game. Each item is equipped with a "Building Cost" card that tells them how resource expensive each item on the card costs. The following table gives a cost breakdown for each item:

This table was generated with [www.tablesgenerator.com](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables).

In the picture above, you can see that each board has hexagons with colored pieces on the vertices, along with circles with labeled numbers in the middle of the hexagon. These colored pieces are known as "settlements," "roads," and "cities," respectively, and the circles indicate how often a two-pair dice roll will land on that hexagon. If you have a settlement or city on a hexagon vertex and the summed value from a dice roll is equivalent to the numbers on your circle, then you get those resources. Now, if you have a settlement, then you would only get one copy of that resource, but if you have a city, then you would get 2 copies. It's very important to note that a city can only be placed on-top of a settlement, and a settlement can only be placed 2 roads (and vertices) away from any other player. When a settlement is replaced with a city, the player is refunded the city. Each player has a total of 15 roads, 5 settlements, and 4 cities. 

#### Victory Points

To win the game, a player must get 10 victory points. Each settlement and city is 1 and 2 victory points, respectively. More on this in [Stage 2](#stage-2).

### Board Layout

Each regular game of Catan consists of 19 hexagonal terrain tiles. The tile distribution is as follows:

- 4 Forest (Lumber),
- 4 Pasture (Wool),
- 4 Fields (Grain),
- 3 Hills (Brick), 
- 3 Mountains (Ore), and
- 1 Desert tile (no resources).

You'll notice that there is a desert tile that we haven't talked about. This tile contains no resources, and is where the robber is placed at the beginning of the game (more on the robber and dice rolls later). There are also 9 ports on the map. These allow players to make discounted trades when a settlement is placed on the vertex that has a harbor dock connecting to it (more on trading in [Stage 2](#stage-2)). Now that you know about resources, tiles, and colored pieces, we can move on to [Stage 1](#stage-1), where we talk about the initial placement of roads and settlements to start the game.

### Stage 1

In this stage, each player will begin by rolling a dice to see who goes first; the highest roll wins. For this first stage, the players go in snake order. That is, the first person places first and 8th (for a 4-person board), the second places second and 7th, the third places third and 6th, and the last places 4th and 5th (the initial order is clockwise). During each player's turn, they can place a settlement and one road. They do this for both turns, but on the second turn, they get the resources from the 3 surrounding hexes. After everyone has placed their 2 settlements and 2 roads, we can start stage 2.

### Stage 2

This is the stage where the main game loop starts. When a player is finished with their turn, they will hand the dice to the player that is clockwise to them. For each turn, the player must roll the dice, but they can play a development card first if they have that available to them. After they roll the dice, then they use resources to buy things like was displayed in the table above. In addition, they can also trade with other players. There is nothing that is off limits when it comes to trade; they can make future deals for resources, or bargain for "no blocks," in which they say they will not rob a player in the future for a card deal. They can also make a 4-1 trade with the bank, where all cards are the same (e.g., 4 wool for 1 brick). If the player has access to a port, then these trades can be modified so that they only have to trade 3 cards for 1, for example. 

In the game, there are also development cards that can be acquired at any point. In the development card pile, you can receive the any of following:

- Knight card (allows the robber to be moved),
- Monopoly (receive all of specific resource from all players),
- Road builder (play 2 roads with no resource cost), and
- Receive 1 victory point 

If you play 3 knight cards, then you receive the largest army card, you gain 2 victory points. Similarly, if you have the longest road (5 continuous roads, which is also greater than any other player's road length), then you also get 2 victory points. 

And that is the gist of how to play Catan! There is a bit more nuance that I wasn't able to get into in this article, so if you run into problems, please consult the actual game rules [here](https://www.catan.com/sites/default/files/2021-06/catan_base_rules_2020_200707.pdf).
